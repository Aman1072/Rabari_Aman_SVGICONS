# Rabari_Aman_SVGICONS

# SVGICON_SET

For this assignment first I created one repository on github and give repository name Rabari_Aman_SVGICONS.
then I have created 10 music instruments icons in illustrator.
after that I have saved all icons which I had created as svg in my working file.
after creating and taking all icons as svg I created one document in which I can show all icons on web page.
I creat proper css structure for document and I also use javascript from which on web page you can know the specific id of icon in console from typing this.id after selecting icon.
the proper structure completed then I pused all branches on main and created this SVGICON-SET assignment.
